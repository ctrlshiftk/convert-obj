# convert-obj

Basic script that parses a .obj file (from blender), extracts the vertex coordinates and writes those vertices to another file, so that they can be rendered using OpenGL.

For now, only converting vertex indices (v) is supported, though, I might revisit this project to add support for converting vertex texture coordinate indices (vt) and vertex normal indices (vn) later on.
